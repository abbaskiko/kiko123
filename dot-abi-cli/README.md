# dot-abi-cli

Generate a DApp CLI scaffold from an ABI

(with Ledger hardware wallet support)

## Motivation

`dot-abi-cli` is a _framework_ for building commandline tools for smart contracts. It automates generating documented commands from comments and types extracted from Solidity code.

It is designed for teams who wish to provide custom CLI tools for their own smart contracts.

If you're interacting with a lot of different contracts and are firing one-off commands, you may find that [seth](https://github.com/dapphub/seth) works better for your needs.

## Automatic Command Generation

Commands are only generated for methods that have solc documentation. For example, a method like this:

```solidity
  /**
  * @notice Makes a purchase of a product.
  * @dev Requires that the value sent is exactly the price of the product
  * @param _productId - the product to purchase
  * @param _numCycles - the number of cycles being purchased. This number should be `1` for non-subscription products and the number of cycles for subscriptions.
  * @param _assignee - the address to assign the purchase to (doesn't have to be msg.sender)
  * @param _affiliate - the address to of the affiliate - use address(0) if none
  */
  function purchase(
    uint256 _productId,
    uint256 _numCycles,
    address _assignee,
    address _affiliate
    )
    external
    payable
    whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256)
  {
    require(_productId != 0);
    require(_numCycles != 0);
    // ...
```

Becomes a command, which appears in help like this:

```
dot-license-cli.js purchase <productId> <numCycles> <assignee> <affiliate>  Makes a purchase of a product.
```

This command could be run as:

```
dot-license-cli.js purchase 1 4 0xdeadbeef 0xdeadbeef --value 12345
```

## Usage

The core steps are:

* Generate a combined ABI
* Create an entrypoint command
* Load your environment variables

An example makes this clearer:

## Cryptokitties CLI Example

Consider the [cryptokitties-cli example](./examples/cryptokitties-cli)

<h1 align="center">

</h1>

1.  Generate a **combined ABI**

e.g. something like:

```shell
docker run -v "$PWD/contracts":/contracts ethereum/solc:stable --combined-json abi,devdoc,userdoc --pretty-json /contracts/KittyCore.sol > ../pathTo/MyCombined.abi.json
```

2.  Create the command entry point as in [`cryptokitties-cli.js`](cryptokitties-cli.js)

This file loads the ABI and creates a commandline tool using the `builder`. The `builder` uses [`yargs`](https://github.com/yargs/yargs) and can be extended accordingly.

This file also configures the Web3 provider. You can use any provider you wish.

3.  Create a `.env` file that contains the necessary environment variables:

```
# .env

KEY_MNEMONIC="my dog has fleas and he goes to church"
WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/remix
NETWORK_ID=1
GAS_PRICE=1000000010
GAS_LIMIT=4700000
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d
```

(This example uses `dotenv`, but of course, you can provide these variables any way you'd like.)

4.  Try it out:

```bash
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/babel-node cryptokitties-cli.js --help

# ... help results ...

./node_modules/.bin/babel-node cryptokitties-cli.js getKitty 3

Result {
  '0': false,
  '1': true,
  '2': '0',
  '3': '0',
  '4': '0',
  '5': '1511417999',
  '6': '0',
  '7': '0',
  '8': '0',
  '9': '516352335416235417056702290154738622491807922722465690508248901653769675',
  isGestating: false,
  isReady: true,
  cooldownIndex: '0',
  nextActionAt: '0',
  siringWithId: '0',
  birthTime: '1511417999',
  matronId: '0',
  sireId: '0',
  generation: '0',
  genes: '516352335416235417056702290154738622491807922722465690508248901653769675'
}
```

## Additional Configuration

For methods (or accessors) that have no documentation, we can provide a configuration manually.

See [`dot-license-cli.js`](../dot-license-cli/bin/dot-license-cli.js) for an example of this.

## Examples

* [Simple: Cryptokitties example](./examples/cryptokitties-cli)
* [Advanced: dotlicense-cli](../dot-license-cli)

## Generating a combined ABI file

This generator uses a "combined" ABI file, merging `abi`, `devdoc`, and `userdoc`. You must use `solc` (and not `solcjs`) for this.

The easiest way is to use Docker like this:

```shell
docker run -v "$PWD/contracts":/contracts ethereum/solc:stable --combined-json abi,devdoc,userdoc --pretty-json /contracts/Contract1.sol /contracts/Contract2.sol > ../pathTo/MyCombined.abi.json
```
